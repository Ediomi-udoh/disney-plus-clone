### Concept
This project is a Disney plus clone (www.disneyplus.com) created with The Movie Database API (https://www.themoviedb.org/).

### Status
Completed, but it can be improved. 
Some examples to improve: 
- Refactor the code. There are some things that are repeated.
- Add localstorage feature.

### Techs
- React.js (useContext, useState, useEffect, react router, etc...)
- Styled Components
- Typescript
- Firebase


## Learned: 
- Interfaces with typescript. It was one of the most difficult parts to implement a type of hooks and functions.
- Routing with react.
- Burger menu with styled-components, hooks, etc.
